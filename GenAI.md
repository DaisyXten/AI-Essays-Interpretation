# GenAI

## GenAI and classic AI
If classic AI is the **wise owl**, generative AI is the wiser owl with **a paintbrush and a knack for writing**.

Traditional AI can recognize, classify, and cluster, but **not generate the data** it is trained on. Plus, classic AI models are usually focused on a **single task**. 

Their generative sisters, on the other hand, are pre-trained on giant amounts of data from a wide range of domains. They can build up general knowledge and use it to generate almost any output in their specific medium (text, image, sound, or other).
